## Identifying the Need for a Scheme

Digital trade, marked by the application of digital technologies to trade and supply chain processes, promises a transformative future. Leveraging these advancements can result in increased efficiency, resilience, and speed for companies, industries, and even nations that deeply hinge on trade for their growth.

Despite its vast potential, the digitalization of trade is progressing at a slow pace. A staggeringly low 5% of merchandise trade has undergone digitalization by most estimates. The slow adoption rate is even more pronounced among Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and emerging markets. These gaps are not without reasons. Multiple barriers stand in the way of digital trade's full potential. From a lack of an enabling policy environment and proliferating, often conflicting digital trade practices and standards, to the capacity deficits and a deep-rooted culture resistant to data sharing, the obstacles are many.

This landscape underscores the need for a conformity assessment scheme. Such a scheme would bridge the divide between the current state and the potential of digital trade. By standardizing practices, ensuring the adherence to best practices, and providing a benchmark for quality and security, the conformity assessment can expedite the digitalization process. It would offer a structured pathway for organizations, especially SMEs and those in emerging markets, to transition seamlessly into the digital trade paradigm. The ultimate aim would be to foster a harmonized, secure, and efficient digital trade ecosystem that capitalizes on the promise of modern technology while minimizing risks.

## Scheme Elements

The scheme applies the functional approach to conformity assessment to provide a standardized framework of basic conformity assessment functions and their relationships. The functional approach identifies the following generic functions or elements:

* **Selection** of the object(s) of conformity assessment,including selecting specified requirements to beassessed and planning information collection and sampling activities.
* **Determination**, including the use of one or more determination methods (e.g. test, audit and/or examination) to develop complete information regarding fulfilment of the specified requirements by the object of conformity assessment or its sample
* **Review, decision and attestation**, including the review of evidence from the determination stage, before taking the decision as to whether or not the object of conformity assessment has been reliably demonstrated to fulfil the specified requirements, and a subsequent attestation based on this decision, and any subsequent marking or licensing and theirrelated controls.
* **Surveillance (if needed)**, including the frequency and extent of surveillance activities and reassessments to ensure the object of conformity assessment continues to fulfil the specified requirements

## Scheme Owner

A scheme owner can be a CAB itself, a governmental authority, an industry association or another body. Standards developing organizations (SDOs) can develop scheme documents and can be scheme owners.

## Principles

* **Impartiality** The operation and implementation of the scheme is impartial, so that it can provide confidence in its outcomes.
Any conflicts of interest are mitigated throughout the operation of the scheme.
* **Openness** Openness means disclosing and giving access to appropriate information, while respecting confidentiality. This includes access to the scheme requirements.
* **Transparency** Schemes are operated and administered in a transparent manner. Transparency means that schemes are developed so that they are accessible, in a non-discriminatory manner, to all interested parties.
* **Improvement** Scheme owners measure their impact and demonstrate progress towards their intended outcomes, and; regularly integrate learning to improve and to increase the benefits for end-users
* **Relevance** Schemes are developed in response to market needs. They are designed to be fit-for-purpose and to hence meet those market needs. 
* **Engagement** A balanced and representative group of interested parties is engaged in the development and management.
* **Truthfulness** Schemes are developed with the aim that the outcomes achieve the intended results and any communication,including claims, is a true and fair reflection of outcomes.
* **Efficiency** All the components of a scheme are structured to deliver measurable, quality outcomes. Schemes contain the necessary requirements to achieve the intended outcomes and do not overburden society.
