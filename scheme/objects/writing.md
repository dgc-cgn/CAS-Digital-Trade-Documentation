# Article 8 Writing

## Overview

Article 8 outlines the criteria to ensure that information in or linked to electronic transferable records is equivalent to its written form. This concept is drawn from article 6, paragraph 1, of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce. Instead of focusing on "communication," Article 8 emphasizes "information" since not all pertinent details might be conveyed, based on the chosen electronic transferable records system.

Article 8 provides a rule establishing that the term "writing" in the context of electronic transferable records maintains its essence and functionality. This notion of writing plays a crucial role in various actions throughout an electronic transferable record's lifespan, such as endorsement. Rules that equate electronic and written forms in electronic transaction laws pertain to all electronic records that aren't designated as transferable.

## Provision on Functional Equivalence

Where the law requires that information should be in writing, that requirement is met with respect to an electronic transferable record if the information contained therein is accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference.

The use of writing is instrumental in performing several actions that may occur during the life cycle of anelectronic transferable record, such as endorsement. The provisions on functional equivalence of written and electronic form contained inthe law on electronic transactions apply to all electronic records that are not transferable.
