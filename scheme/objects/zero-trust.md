# Zero Trust

Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a strategic approach to cybersecurity that secures an organisation by eliminating implicit trust and continuously validating every stage of a digital interaction. Rooted in the principle of “never trust, always verify,” Zero Trust is designed to protect modern environments and enable digital transformation by using strong authentication methods, leveraging network
segmentation, preventing lateral movement, providing Layer 7 threat prevention, and simplifying granular, “least access” policies.

Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a security model that challenges traditional network security paradigms. Instead of relying on traditional network boundaries to secure assets, ZTA operates under the principle of "never trust, always verify." In this model, trust is not implicit within the network, regardless of whether the access originates from within or outside the organizational boundary.

## Key Characterists of Zero Trust Architecture

Key Characteristics of ZTA:

* **No Implicit Trust:** Every access request is treated as if it originates from an untrusted network, regardless of where the request originates.
* **Least Privilege Access:** Users, devices, and applications are given the minimum amount of access necessary to perform their tasks.
* **Micro-segmentation:** Networks are segmented into small parts, reducing unauthorized access and lateral movement of potential threats.
* **Continuous Authentication & Verification:** Users and devices are continuously authenticated and their security postures verified, ensuring that they still meet the required criteria for access.
* **Integrated Security Stack:** ZTA integrates various security solutions (like multi-factor authentication, identity and access management, and security information and event management) to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Objectives of the Assessment on Zero Trust Architecture:

* **Understanding & Documentation:** Identify and document the current security posture of the organization and map out the existing network and security infrastructure.
* **Gap Analysis:** Determine any gaps between the organization's current architecture and ZTA principles, understanding vulnerabilities and potential risk areas.
* **Access Policies:** Evaluate the efficacy and comprehensiveness of access policies to ensure they align with least privilege principles. Also, assess how policies are defined, managed, and enforced.
* **User & Device Identity:** Evaluate the methods and tools used for user and device identification, including how identities are verified and credentials are managed.
* **Data Protection:** Assess how data is protected both in transit and at rest. This includes evaluating encryption standards and key management processes.
* **Threat Detection & Response:** Determine the organization's capability to detect and respond to security incidents. Understand how indicators of compromise (IoCs) are tracked and how automated responses are configured.
* **Micro-segmentation Strategy:** Assess the segmentation of the network and whether it effectively minimizes the risk of lateral movement within the network.
* **Integration and Interoperability:** Examine how different security solutions are integrated and whether they operate in harmony, ensuring that there are no gaps in protection.
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Evaluate tools and processes for continuous monitoring of network activity, ensuring that anomalies are quickly identified and acted upon.
* **Stakeholder Communication:** Assess how security information is communicated across the organization, ensuring that all stakeholders understand and are aligned with the zero trust principles.
* **Training & Awareness:** Evaluate the organization's training and awareness programs to ensure that staff is knowledgeable about security best practices and the importance of ZTA.
* **Future Proofing:** Ensure the ZTA implementation is scalable and flexible to accommodate future growth and changes in the organization's environment.



## Conformity Assessment Approach

1. Access privileges are centred around the resources that are being used.
2. Mutual authentication
3. Time-limited use of data.
