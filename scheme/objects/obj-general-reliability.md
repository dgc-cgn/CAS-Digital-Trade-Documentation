# General Reliability

General reliability refers to the consistency and dependability of a system, process, or mechanism in performing its intended function under specific conditions. General reliability is a crucial quality in systems, processes, and products across various domains, ensuring they function effectively, safely, and consistently over time. Reliable systems are trusted by users and are fundamental to the success and safety of organizations and individuals alike.

Article 12 establishes a framework for assessing the general reliability of electronic transferable records and their management systems. It provides an objective standard and considers various factors influencing reliability, allowing for flexibility and customization in reliability assessments while also acknowledging the role of party agreements and industry standards.

The general reliability standard outlined in Article 12 is applicable to all providers of electronic transferable records management systems. THe standard allows for the customization of reliability assessments for each function fulfilled by the system. This approach provides flexibility, as each provision of the Model Law referring to the use of a reliable method aims at fulfilling different functions.

## Assessment Approach

The assessment of reliability should consider various factors, including operational rules, data integrity assurance, prevention of unauthorized access, security of hardware and software, regular audits by independent bodies, declarations by supervisory or accreditation bodies, and compliance with applicable industry standards.

Article 12 acknowledges that a method can be deemed reliable if it has proven to fulfill its intended function, either by itself or together with further evidence. This provision acts as a safety clause, validating methods that have effectively achieved their function regardless of any assessment of their reliability.

## Assessment Critieria

* Appropriate reliable methods for the fulfillment of the relevant function(s) shall be provided.

* Any applicable industry standard;
* Proven in fact to have fulfilled the function by itself or together with further evidence.

## Assessment Determination
