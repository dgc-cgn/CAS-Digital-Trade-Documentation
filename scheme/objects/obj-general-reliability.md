# General Reliability

## Overview

- Article 12 provides a consistent and technology-neutral general standard for assessing reliability whenever a provision of the Model Law requires the use of a “reliable method” for fulfilling its functions (Page 53).
- The general reliability standard is applicable to all electronic transferable records management system providers, not only to third-party service providers.
- The assessment of reliability should be carried out separately for each relevant method in light of the function specifically pursued by the use of that method

## Asssement of Reliabilty

- The reliability of a method is assessed based on its appropriateness for fulfilling the function for which it is being used, considering all relevant circumstances (Page 18).
- Relevant circumstances may include operational rules, data integrity assurance, prevention of unauthorized access and use of the system, security of hardware and software, regular and extensive audits by an independent body, declarations by supervisory or accreditation bodies, and compliance with applicable industry standards (Page 18)

## Industry Standards

- [ ] Applicable industry standards should preferably be internationally recognized to promote a common notion of reliability across jurisdictions (Page 57).
- [ ] Reference to industry standards should not violate the principle of technological neutrality or favor the standards of one sector over another.

## Design and Compliance

- Designers of electronic transferable records management systems need to comply with the general reliability standard and specific standards to establish commercially viable enterprises (Page 74).
- The content of Article 12 influences the design of the system since system designers aim to provide reliable systems (Page 54).

## Party Agreements

[ ] Party agreements can be significant, especially in closed systems or when referring to industry standards, as they often contain useful guidance on technical details and may promote technological innovation within the limits of mandatory substantive law (Page 57).
