# Criteria

## Criterion 1: Same Information

* The electronic record must contain the same information as would be contained in a paper [equivalent] transferable document or instrument.

## Criterion 2: Singularity

The term "singularity" as it relates to an electronic transferable document denotes the state of being exclusive, unique, and non-duplicable, ensuring the authenticity and guarantee of the rights and obligations expressed in the record and usually accorded to the holder of the record. Singularity ensures that there is only one authoritative instance of the electronic record which can be executed upon that is identifiable, verifiable, and traceable ensure the legitimacy of its origin and intent. All other instances are considered to be copies, facsimiles, that while important for evidentiary and audit purposes, do not convey the authority of the singular instance.

Singularity, as implemented in electronic transferable records, often leverages cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology to guarantee that a particular digital instance exists in a exclusive, unreplicable state, thereby securing the legitimacy of electronic transactions and exchanges. The singularity concept is paramount in scenarios to validate ownership, safeguard transactions, and uphold the reliability of digital interactions.

* A reliable method must be used identify that the electronic record as the authoritative electronic record constituting the electronic transferable record.

## Criterion 3: Control

* A reliable system must be used to render an electronic record capable of being subject to control from its creation until it ceases to
have any effect or validity

## Criterion 4: Integrity

* A reliable system must be used to retain the integrity of that electronic record

## Criterion 5: Reliable System

* The system must employ reliable methods for Criteria 2 to 4.

## Defintions

* **Same Information**

* **A Reliable Method must be used to: (i) identify that
electronic record as the electronic transferable record (Singularity); (ii) render that electronic record capable of being subject to exclusive control (Exclusive Control); and(iii) retain the integrity of the electronic record (Integrity)
