## Overview

The WEF Digital Trust Framework defines measures for leaders to be able to evaluate an organization’s progress towards digital trust goals and the maturity of digital trust dimensions. The measures are primarily meant for organizational leaders for acomprehensive approach to
earning digital trust.The framework makes the case that standardization is critical when building digital trust through technology products, and without standards, ethical decisions can appear subjective and ad-hoc.

**Digital trust** is individuals’ expectation that digital technologies and services – and the organizations providing them – will protect all stakeholders’ interests and uphold societal expectations and values.

## Digital Trust Framework

The Forum’s digital trust framework defines goals and dimensions of digital trust decision-making to serve as a tool to guide organizational leaders exploring how best to earn digital trust.

### Accountability and Oversight

* **Transparency** requires honesty and clarity around digital operations and uses. Enabling visibility into an organization’s digital processes reduces the information asymmetry between an organization and its stakeholders while signalling to individuals that the organization intends not only to act in the individual’s interests but also to make those actions known and understandable to those inside and outside of the organization.

* **Redressability** represents the possibility of obtaining recourse where individuals, groups or entities have been negatively affected by technological processes, systems or data uses. With the understanding that unintentional errors or unexpected factors can cause unanticipated harms, trustworthy organizations have robust methods for redress when recourse is sought and mechanisms in place to make individuals whole when they have been harmed.

* **Auditability** is the ability of both an organization and third parties to review and confirm the activities and results of technology, data processing and governance processes. Auditability serves as a check on an organization’s commitments and signals its intent to follow through on those commitments.

### Security and Reliability

* **Cybersecurity** focuses on the security of digital systems – including the underlying data, technologies and processes. Effective cybersecurity mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and damage to digital processes and systems, ensuring resiliency. It also ensures the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems.

* **Safety** encompasses efforts to prevent harm (e.g. emotional, physical or psychological) to people or society from technology uses and data processing.

* **Privacy** for individuals, is the expectation of control over or confidentiality of their personal or personally identifiable information. For organizations, privacy is the meeting of this expectation through the design and manifestation of data processing that facilitates individual autonomy through notice and control over the collection, use and sharing of personal information.

## Inclusive Ethicial and Responsible Use

* **Fairness** requires that an organization is aware of the potential for technology and data processing to have a disparate impact and that it aims to achieve just and equitable outcomes for all stakeholders, given the relevant circumstances and expectations.

* **Interoperability** is the ability of information systems to connect and exchange information for mutual use without undue burden or restriction.

## Applicability to Digital Trade Document Conformity Assessment Scheme

### Key Points

* Oriented toward organization-level digital trust.
* Provides a good overall principles-based framework with broad (but subjective measures).
* Makes the case that standards need to be used.
* Has a general definition for *Interoperabilty* that may be useful starting point for conformity assessment scheme: *Interoperability is the ability of information systems to connect and exchange information for mutual use without undue burden or restriction.*
* Does not provide specifics for a digital trade conformity assessment scheme.

### Bottomline Recommendations

* Incorporate key elements into the broader Digital Trust Conformity Assessment Program.
* Ensure that the Digital Trade Conformity Assessment Scheme aligns with/complements concepts outlined in the framework (in particular Interoperability)
