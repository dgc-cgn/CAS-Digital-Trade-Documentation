## Master References for the Cross-Border Supply Chain

|Reference|What it does|Why It's important|
|---|---|---|
|[UN/Core Component Library (CCL)](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/unccl)|The United Nations Core Component Library (UN/CCL) is a library of business semantics in a data model which is harmonised, audited and published by UN/CEFACT.|Ensure consistency and interoperability. The Semantic base definitions are compatible with all other UN/CEFACT deliverables and mappable with many other organisations’ data models such as WCO, IATA, GS1, etc.|
|[UN/CEFACT Buy-Ship-Pay Reference Data Model (BSP-RDM)](https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/rdm)|The Buy-Ship-Pay Reference Data Model describes the requirements for a generic reference data model supporting the trade and transport-related processes involved in the cross-border supply chain and covering, at a high-level, the involved business areas, the main parties and the information involved. It provides the framework for any cross-border transport-related business and government domains to specify their own specific information exchange requirements1 while complying with the overall processes and data structures.|It can be applied by any country, region or industry community to provide the definitions of contextualised transport-related data exchange documents which can be integrated into software solutions for traders, carriers,freight forwarders, agents, banks,customs and other governmentalauthorities etc.|
|[UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (2017)](https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/ecommerce/modellaw/electronic_transferable_records)|The Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) aims to enable the legal use of electronic transferable records both domestically and across borders. The MLETR applies to electronic transferable records that are functionally equivalent to transferable documents or instruments. Transferable documents or instruments are paper-based documents or instruments (such as bills of lading, bills of exchange, promissory notes and warehouse receipts) that entitle the holder to claim the performance of the obligation indicated therein and that allow the transfer of the claim to that performance by transferring possession of the document or instrument.|The MLETR builds on the principles of non-discrimination against the use of electronic means, functional equivalence and technology neutrality underpinning all UNCITRAL texts on electronic commerce. It may therefore accommodate the use of all technologies and of all models, such as registries, tokens and distributed ledgers.|
|[ISO 15000 series](https://www.iso.org/standard/79108.html) [Electronic business eXtensible Markup Language (ebXML)](https://www.iso.org/standard/79108.html)|Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language, commonly known as e-business XML, or ebXML, is a family of XML based standards sponsored by OASIS and UN/CEFACT. XML defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable, enabling two disparate systems to exchange information.|It can provide an open infrastructure that enables the global use of electronic business information in an interoperable, secure, and consistent manner by all types of organisations (e.g., commercial enterprises,government agencies, not-for-profit organisations).|

## Identifier Standards for Subjects and Objects

### Identfier Standards for Subjects

|Type|Applicable Standard|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)|[LEI ISO 17442](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei)|The LEI connects to key reference information that enables clear and unique identification of legal entities. LEI issuers—also referred to as Local Operating Units (LOUs)—provide registration,renewal and other services, and act as the primary interface for businesses to obtain2 an LEI. The LEI data are available for any user free of charge on <www.gleif.org>.|
|Decentralised Identifier (DID)|[W3C DID](http://www.w3.org/TR/did-core)|A type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralised digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organisation, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralised registries, identity providers and certificate authorities.|
|Physical Locations or Parties|[Global Location Number (GLN)](http://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/gln)|An identifier of an organisation’s physical or logical addresses (Ship From, Ship To, etc.) and internal locations.|
|Business Identifier Code (BIC)|[ISO 9362](https://www.swift.com/standards/data-standards/bic-business-identifier-code)|The BIC is used for addressing messages, routing business transactions and identifying business parties within the financial services industry. SWIFT in its role of ISO registration authority issues BICs4. The BIC is used in financial transactions, client and counterparty databases, compliance documents and many others, although not all BICs are connected to the SWIFT network used by banks and other institutions for financial messaging.|
|Trader Identification Number (TIN)|[TIN](http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/facilitation/instrument-and-tools/tools/trader-identification-number.aspx)|A globally unique identification number that can be used for retrieving underlying information relating to an economic operator involved in cross-border supply chain, to enable customs administrations to  perform the appropriate actions, particularly in the context of mutual recognition arrangements/agreements of authorised economic operators.|

### Identfier Standards for Objects

|Type|Applicable Standard|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|Product Code|[Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System](https://www.wcotradetools.org/en/harmonized-system) (HS code)|A multi-purpose international product nomenclature developed by the WCO, used in customs and trade procedures.|
||[Global Product Classification](https://www.gs1.org/standards/gpc) (GPC)|A GS1 standard that helps global trade partners to classify products by grouping them into categories based on their essential properties as well as their relationships to other products in GS1 related systems.|
|Products or Individual Trade Item Instance(s)|United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC)|A global classification system of products and services in all industry sectors, managed by GS1 US for the UN Development Programme (UNDP)5. Enables procurement teams to conduct spend intelligence, improve strategic sourcing and monitor spending limits.|
||Global Trade Item Number(GTIN),|Identifies products at any packaging level (e.g., consumer unit, inner pack, case, pallet). Individual instance(s) can be uniquely identified by combining the GTIN with batch/lot number, serial number.|
|Logistic Units|Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC)|Enables the unique identification of any combination of trade items packaged together for storage and/or transport purposes,such as unit loads on pallets or roll cages, and parcels.|
|Shipments|Global Shipment Identification Number (GSIN)|A global unique number assigned by a seller and shipper of goods to identify a shipment comprising one or more logistic units that are intended to be delivered together.|
|Consignments|Global Identification Number of Consignment (GINC)|Comprising one or more logistic units (potentially belonging to different shipments) intended to be transported together for part of their journey.|
||Unique Consignment Reference (UCR)|A reference number for customs use and may be required to be reported to customs at any point during a customs procedure.|
|Documents|Global Document Type Identifier (GDTI)|Identifies the type of the document (physical or electronic) such as order, invoice, receipt and other trade documents, etc. and if needed also the individual document instances via the optional serial number.|
|Unique Identification|ISO/IEC 15459|This series of standards specifies the generation of unique identifiers for transport units, individual products, individual returnable transport items and groupings of items. It makes provision for a registration authority that recognises issuing
agencies (e.g., GS1, FIATA, UPU) managing identification systems. Primarily used for automatic identification and data capture applications (barcodes and RFID).|
