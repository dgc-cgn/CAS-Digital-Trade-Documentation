# Overview

## Conformance with Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records

The scheme is organized to effect the achievement two strategic outcomes: **Legal Certaintiy** and **Commercial Predictability**
These strategic outcomes are underpinned by two broad characteristics: **Reliability** and **Interoperabilty** , which can be assessed in three areas:

* **General Reliability** as reliable as appropriate for the fulfilment of the function for which the method is being used.
* **General Interoperability** interoperabilty as appropriate for ease of transferabilty through various ecosystems.
* **Functional Equivalence** the production of same outcomes or results despite variations in methods.
* **Technical Standards/Specifications, Data Formats** that have been adopted/implemented by the digital trade community.
