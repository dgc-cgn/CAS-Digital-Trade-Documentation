# Working Group Draft Scheme

## Context Overview

This is the working group draft conformity assessment scheme. The digram below depicts a minimum viable product (MVP) that can be developed and tested.

## Scope of Application

The initial scope of application is for intended for **trade documents**, but with the view that the scheme can be applied to the related categories of **negotiable documents** and **title documents**.

### Background and Considerations

The purpose of title documents and negotiables are generally to identify current or future rights to goods or services. Until the advent of digital capabilities future rights were bound to physical objects, such as, paper documents or any other physical object that can carry writing.

MLETR enables the possibility that electronic transferable records can take the place of physical objects, in other words, any object (digital or physical) can entitle the holder to claim the peformance of the obligation indicated by the object, subject to legislation enacted by the jurisdiction. For example, the issance of railroad tickets and/or rail transport documents, which are already governed through legislation, could be covered by MLETR and enforced by the applicable legislation. In other cases, such as theatre tickets and other presentation documents giving access to services can also be considered as transferable instruments, where MLETR could be applied, but not subject to any specific applicable legislation.

While the technical requirements defined in MLETR are general and provide minimum requirements to comply with the intentions of the relevant lawmakers, the intention of this scheme is to provide additional specifity to support a conformity assessment and certification program.

MLETR compliant solutions are intended to provide high quality data management and ensure tamper-free evidence, unambiguous possession/control of the asset or claim the performance described in the electronic transferable record. 

Applied more broadly, MLETR can address many use cases beyond trade, trade financing and banking. Paper-based processes have been identified as a major obstacle for improving efficiencies and there are many other areas beyond trade, depending on local legislation, where MLETR can be applied and have a major impact. For example, in many countries mortgage loans and title deeds need to be issued as negotiable promissory notes. The transferability of mortage loans and promissory notes can be enhanced and made more secure using MLTER. Even more broadly, electronic transferable records could be used in other financial arrangements, such as surety,  guarantees  or Stand by Letters of Credit. Using electronic transferable records can make these arrangements more manageable for all stakeholders, especially when the commitment is tied to an object such as a building or a vessel and not to a person.

While the initial intent of this scheme is limited in scope, the scheme is being developed in consideration of how MLETR and electronic transferable records can serve society in a wider area, without limiting its impact to only trade,logistics and trade finance

## Categories of Documents

This scheme is intended to be applied in relation to the following categories of documents.

- **Trade Documents:**  Documents that can be used in the buying and selling of goods and provide information such as product information,quantity, quality, and other relevant details essential for the transaction.
- **Title Documents:** Documents that can be used to establish the ownership of the goods and are crucial in the transfer of ownership from the seller to the buyer.
- **Negotiable Documents:** Documents that can be transferred from one party to another, typically through endorsement or delivery, allowing the holder to claim the goods or receive the benefits outlined in the document.

### Objects of Conformity

The objects of conformity

1. [Reliable Systems Assurance](./obj-reliable-system.md)
2. [Integrity](./obj-integrity.md)
3. [Singularity](./obj-singularity.md)
4. [Exclusive Control](./obj-exclusive-control.md)

### General Requirements

General requirements that apply to the implementation and/or accreditaton of the conformity assessment scheme.

1. Accreditation of Independent Entities: Ensuring that entities responsible for verifying the technical procedures' suitability are properly accredited.
2. Monitoring and Surveillance: Implementing processes to continuously monitor compliance with these criteria and applicabe regulatory provisions.
3. Documentation and Records Keeping: Verifying that all required documents, changes, and transactions are properly documented and preserved.
4. Complaints and Feedback Mechanism: Establishing a system to handle complaints and feedback related to the electronic documents and the conformity assessment process.
