# Object of Conformity: Integrity

## Overview

"Integrity" refers to the maintenance of the complete and unaltered nature of an electronic transferable record, except for changes that arise in the normal course of its handling, storage, and display.

### Completeness of the Record

Integrity implies that all the information that is required to be contained in the record is present and can be displayed or produced whenever needed. This includes not just the main content of the record but also any associated data necessary for understanding the record.

### Authenticity of the Record

Verification that the record is issued and signed by the issuer and subsequent entries are made and signed by authorized persons.

### Unaltered State

The record should remain in an unaltered state throughout its lifecycle. Any changes, modifications, or amendments to the record should be clearly indicated and should not compromise the original information. The record must reliably represent what it purports to represent.

### Changes in the Course of Transactions

Exceptions to the unaltered state are changes that are a part of the normal course of handling the record. For instance, endorsements or other routine transactions related to the record should be traceable and verifiable.

### Technology Neutrality

The MLETR does not prescribe specific technologies or methods for ensuring integrity, allowing for the use of various suitable and evolving technologies as long as they maintain the recordâ€™s integrity.
