# Object of Conformity: Singularity

[Draft Scheme](./wgdraftscheme.md)

## Context Overview

The term "singularity" as it relates to an electronic transferable document denotes the state of being exclusive, unique, and non-duplicable, ensuring the authenticity and guarantee of the rights and obligations expressed in the record and usually accorded to the holder of the record. Singularity ensures that there is only one authoritative instance of the electronic record which can be executed upon that is identifiable, verifiable, and traceable ensure the legitimacy of its origin and intent. All other instances are considered to be copies, facsimiles, that while important for evidentiary and audit purposes, do not convey the authority of the singular instance.

Singularity, as implemented in electronic transferable records, often leverages cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology to guarantee that a particular digital instance exists in a exclusive, unreplicable state, thereby securing the legitimacy of electronic transactions and exchanges. The singularity concept is paramount in scenarios to validate ownership, safeguard transactions, and uphold the reliability of digital interactions.

Unique Instance of the Record: Singularity means that, despite the ease of copying and distributing electronic data, there must be a mechanism in place to designate one instance of an electronic transferable record as the unique and authoritative one.

Prevention of Duplication: A core challenge addressed by the principle of singularity is preventing unauthorized duplication of the record. In the digital realm, where duplication is easy, singularity ensures that there is a clear and recognizable distinction between the authoritative record and any copies.

Transfer of Control: Singularity is closely linked to the concept of control. When an electronic transferable record is transferred from one party to another, it is the control over the singular authoritative instance of the record that is transferred, thus maintaining its uniqueness.

Technology Neutrality: The MLETR promotes technology neutrality, meaning it does not prescribe specific technologies or methods to achieve singularity. Instead, it allows for the use of various technologies as long as they can effectively ensure the singular nature of the electronic record.

Integrity and Singularity: Singularity is closely related to integrity. While integrity ensures that the record remains complete and unaltered (except for changes arising in the normal course of its handling), singularity ensures that there is only one such record that is recognized as the authoritative version.
