The Digital Standards Initiative (DSI) of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the Digital Governance Council (DGC) of Canada have collaborated to develop a Technical Assessment Framework for evaluating the reliability of digital services or networks that enable the transfer of Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs) within supply chains.

## Overview
This new framework provides a standardized method for assessing the reliability of platforms that support the use of ETRs in place of traditional paper-based trade documentation. The assessment aligns with the Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR), offering a clear benchmark for service providers to demonstrate their platformâ€™s capability to execute reliable ETR transfers in compliance with global standards.

As more countries adopt the MLETR, this framework establishes a common market standard for evaluating the reliability of platforms handling ETRs. Service providers can use the framework to showcase their adherence to these standards, which are increasingly recognized worldwide.

## Development and Collaboration
The ICC DSI and DGC have led the creation of this assessment framework with contributions from a diverse working group, including:

* Standards bodies
* Technical experts
* Assessment firms
* Commercial and industry stakeholders

The working group also received strategic guidance from the Industry Advisory Board of the ICC DSI, ensuring that the framework is robust, technically sound, and aligned with industry needs.

## Beta Release
The assessment framework has undergone initial piloting with several ETR service providers to evaluate its utility, market relevance, and effectiveness. It is now available as a beta version for self-assessment. Plans are underway to introduce a certification program with third-party assessments.
