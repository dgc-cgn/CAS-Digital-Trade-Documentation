# Reliability Assessment Framework – FAQ
## About the Assessment
This section explains the significance and relevance of the framework.

### 1. What is the Reliability Assessment Framework?

The Reliability Assessment Framework is a self-assessment tool designed to evaluate the reliability of digital platforms that manage electronic transferable records (ETRs). It aligns with the definition of reliability set out in the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records and incorporates the three core principles of the “Trust supply chain,” introduced in DSI’s Trust in Trade paper.

### 2. Why is this framework important for MLETR implementation?

The MLETR requires systems handling ETRs to demonstrate reliability, based on the principles of integrity, singularity, and exclusive control. This framework helps platforms assess whether they conform to these requirements, using a technology-neutral approach.

### 3. What are the key benefits of using this framework for businesses?

By using the Reliability Assessment Framework, platforms handling ETRs can demonstrate conformity with MLETR’s reliability criteria, enhancing their credibility in global trade. It also helps platform users reduce operational risks and increase confidence in adopting secure digital trade solutions.

## For Digital Systems Service Providers

This section provides insights for digital platform providers who want to assess their systems.

### 4. How does the framework assess the reliability of a digital platform?

The framework evaluates a platform's technical and operational features, such as data security, system integrity, user authentication, and the ability to maintain control over ETRs. It also checks for conformity with industry standards and operational rules to ensure alignment with MLETR’s reliability criteria.

### 5. How should service providers prepare for the assessment?

Service providers can access the beta version of the framework for self-assessment online. They should review the framework’s guidelines and ensure that their platform's technical and operational features meet key reliability standards, such as data security, system integrity, user authentication and so on, to demonstrate their capabilities.

### 6. What are the outcomes of going through the assessment?

Any service provider or entity offering digital trade solutions, particularly those handling ETRs such as electronic bills of lading, can use the framework for self-assessment, without any fees. However, if a service provider wishes to obtain a Statement of Verification to demonstrate conformity with the reliability criteria, a small processing fee applies. This statement of verification can be used to showcase conformity and build trust with potential clients. Please note that the statement of verification does not constitute an endorsement of the platform or its services.

### 7. Can I get a certification?

Currently, the framework is available for self-assessment. However, plans are underway to develop a certification process with third-party validation. This will offer greater assurance to users and industry participants that service providers meet the required reliability standards.

## For Industry Users
This section seeks to help industry players looking to utilize the framework in selecting reliable service providers.

### 8. How should I use the Reliability Assessment Framework in selecting vendors?

Industry users can use the assessment framework to develop criteria for selecting a vendor or refer to the service provider’s Statement of Verification. This verification ensures that a platform conforms to reliability standards for handling ETRs, reducing operational risks in digital trade transactions. However, the statement of verification should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the platform or its services.

### 9. Is there a reliability assessment for supply chain partners?

While the current framework focuses on the reliability of digital systems, a specific assessment for supply chain partners, particularly concerning data handling and management processes, may be developed in the future. This would help evaluate the reliability of partners across the supply chain.
